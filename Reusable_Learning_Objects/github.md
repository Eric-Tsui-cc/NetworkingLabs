This lab will introduce you to Github. Before starting, ensure you have the following:

*A Linux-based system (Ubuntu, Fedora, etc.)
*Terminal access
*A GitHub account (Sign up here if you don't have one)
*Basic knowledge of using the terminal

## Installing git

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
```

Verify Installation:
After installation, verify that Git is installed correctly by checking its version:

BASH
git --version
Expected Output:

TEXT
git version 2.x.x
üõ† Step 2: Configure Git
Set up your Git configuration with your name and email. These details will appear in your commit messages.

BASH
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
Verify Configuration:

BASH
git config --list
Expected Output:

TEXT
user.name=Your Name
user.email=your.email@example.com
...
üîë Step 3: Generate SSH Key (Optional but Recommended)
Using SSH keys allows for secure communication between your local machine and GitHub without repeatedly entering your credentials.

Check for Existing SSH Keys:
BASH
ls -al ~/.ssh
Look for files named id_rsa and id_rsa.pub or similar.

Generate a New SSH Key:
If you don't have an SSH key, generate one:

BASH
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your.email@example.com"
If your system doesn't support Ed25519, use RSA:

BASH
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your.email@example.com"
Follow the prompts:

Enter file in which to save the key: Press Enter to accept the default location.
Enter passphrase: (Optional) Add a passphrase for added security or press Enter for none.
Add SSH Key to SSH-Agent:
Start the SSH agent in the background:

BASH
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
Add your SSH private key to the agent:

BASH
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
Replace id_ed25519 with your key filename if different.

Add SSH Key to GitHub:
Copy the SSH Key to Clipboard:

BASH
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
Select and copy the output.

Add to GitHub:

Log in to your GitHub account.
Go to Settings > SSH and GPG keys > New SSH key.
Title: Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "Linux Laptop").
Key: Paste the copied SSH key.
Click Add SSH key.
Test SSH Connection:
BASH
ssh -T git@github.com
Expected Output:

TEXT
Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
üìÅ Step 4: Create a GitHub Repository
Log in to GitHub and click the + icon in the top-right corner, then select New repository.

Fill in Repository Details:

Repository name: my-first-repo
Description: (Optional) e.g., "This is my first repository."
Privacy: Choose between Public or Private.
Initialize: Do not check "Initialize this repository with a README" since we'll do it via CLI.
Click Create repository.

üñ• Step 5: Clone the Repository to Your Local Machine
Navigate to the directory where you want to store your project.

BASH
cd ~/projects
If the projects directory doesn't exist, create it:

BASH
mkdir ~/projects
cd ~/projects
Clone Using SSH:
BASH
git clone git@github.com:your-username/my-first-repo.git
Or Clone Using HTTPS:
If you chose not to set up SSH.

BASH
git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-first-repo.git
Navigate into the repository:

BASH
cd my-first-repo
‚úèÔ∏è Step 6: Make Changes, Commit, and Push to GitHub
1. Create a New File:
Create a simple README file.

BASH
echo "# My First Repository" > README.md
2. Check Repository Status:
BASH
git status
Expected Output:

TEXT
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        README.md
3. Add Files to Staging Area:
BASH
git add README.md
Alternatively, add all changes:

BASH
git add .
4. Commit the Changes:
BASH
git commit -m "Add README.md"
Expected Output:

TEXT
[main (root-commit) abcdefg] Add README.md
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 README.md
5. Push Changes to GitHub:
BASH
git push origin main
If your default branch is master, replace main with master.

If using HTTPS, you might be prompted for your GitHub username and password or a personal access token.

Expected Output:

TEXT
Enumerating objects: 3, done.
Counting objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 245 bytes | 245.00 KiB/s, done.
Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
To github.com:your-username/my-first-repo.git
 * [new branch]      main -> main
üîç Step 7: Verify Changes on GitHub
Go to your repository on GitHub: https://github.com/your-username/my-first-repo

You should see the README.md file with the content # My First Repository.

üìÇ Additional Commands and Tips
1. Checking Status and History:
Check Status:

BASH
git status
View Commit History:

BASH
git log
Press q to exit the log view.

2. Creating and Switching Branches:
Create a New Branch:

BASH
git branch feature-branch
Switch to the New Branch:

BASH
git checkout feature-branch
Or combine both:

BASH
git checkout -b feature-branch
3. Merging Branches:
Switch to main Branch:

BASH
git checkout main
Merge Changes:

BASH
git merge feature-branch
4. Pulling Updates:
If collaborating, always pull the latest changes before pushing.

BASH
git pull origin main
5. Cloning Another Repository:
BASH
git clone git@github.com:another-user/another-repo.git
üß™ Practice Exercise
To reinforce your learning, try the following exercise:

Create a new repository on GitHub named test-repo-cli.
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Create a new file called hello.txt with the content Hello, GitHub CLI!.
Add, commit, and push the changes to GitHub.
Verify that hello.txt appears in your GitHub repository.
