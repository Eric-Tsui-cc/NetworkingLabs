###  Introduction to Bash


The Linux terminal is a powerful tool that allows users to interact with the operating system through text-based commands. Bash (Bourne Again SHell) is the default command-line interpreter for most Linux distributions, including Ubuntu.

### Navigating the File System and Managing Files

Familiarize yourself with essential Linux commands that will be frequently used in scripting:

You should now be roughly familiar with the following commands  

```
pwd	Displays the current directory path.
ls	Lists files and directories.
cd	Changes the current directory.
mkdir	Creates a new directory.
touch	Creates a new empty file.
cp	Copies files or directories.
mv	Moves or renames files or directories.
rm	Removes files or directories.
echo	Displays a line of text/string.
cat	Concatenates and displays file content.
```

Open the Terminal:

Locate the terminal icon on your desktop or access it via the applications menu.
Display Current Directory:

Create a new directory:

    mkdir LabFiles
    cd LabFiles

Create a New File:

    touch notes.txt

Write Content to the File:

    echo "This is a Bash scripting lab." > notes.txt

Display File Content:

    cat notes.txt

Copy the File:

    cp notes.txt backup_notes.txt

Rename the File:

    mv backup_notes.txt old_notes.txt

Remove a File:

    rm old_notes.txt

Reflection Questions
 * What command did you use to create a new directory?
 * How can you view the contents of a file without opening it in a GUI besed text editor?
 * What is the difference between cp and mv commands?

### Creating and Executing Basic Bash Scripts

Bash scripts are text files containing a series of commands that the Bash interpreter executes sequentially. They are used to automate repetitive tasks, manage system operations, and perform complex workflows.

    cd ~/LabFiles

Create a New Script File:

    nano hello_world.sh

Add the Following Content to the Script:

    BASH
    #!/bin/bash
    echo "Hello, World!"
    Save and Exit:

Press CTRL + X, then Y, and ENTER to save the file.
Make the Script Executable:

    chmod 777 hello_world.sh

Execute the Script:

    ./hello_world.sh

    nano hello_world.sh

Modify the echo Command:

    echo "Welcome to the Bash scripting lab!"

Save and Execute:

    ./hello_world.sh

Reflection Questions
 * What is the purpose of the chmod +x command?
 * Why do we use the shebang (#!/bin/bash) at the beginning of scripts?
 * How can you modify the script to display a personalized message?

### Implementing Loops and Conditionals

Loops allow repeated execution of a set of commands. Common loops include for, while, and until.

Conditionals enable scripts to make decisions based on certain conditions using if, elif, else statements.

Create a New Script:

BASH
    nano system_info.sh

Add the Following Content:

```
#!/bin/bash

echo "System Information Script"

# Display current user
echo "Current User: $(whoami)"

# Loop through the next five numbers
for i in {1..5}
do
    echo "Iteration: $i"
    sleep 1s
done

# Conditional Statement
read -p "Enter a number between 1 and 10: " number

if ! [[ "$number" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]]; then
    echo "Invalid input: Please enter a numeric value."
    continue
fi

if [ "$number" -le 5 ]; then
    echo "You entered a number less than or equal to 5."
elif [ "$number" -le 10 ]; then
    echo "You entered a number greater than 5 but less than or equal to 10."
else
    echo "Number out of range."
fi
```

Save and Make Executable:


    chmod 777 system_info.sh

Run the Script:

    ./system_info.sh

Sample Interaction:

Reflection Questions
 * How does the for loop in the script operate?
 * What happens if a user enters a number greater than 10?
 * How can you modify the script to handle invalid inputs gracefully?

### Automating System Monitoring Tasks

Automate the monitoring of system resources such as CPU usage, memory usage, and disk space.

Create a New Script:

    nano resource_monitor.sh

Add the Following Content:

```
#!/bin/bash

echo "System Resource Monitoring"

# Number of iterations
read -p "How many times would you like to monitor the system? " iterations

# Loop based on user input
for ((i=1; i<=iterations; i++))
do
    echo "----- Monitoring $i -----"
    
    # Display CPU usage
    echo "CPU Usage:"
    top -b -n1 | grep "Cpu(s)"

    # Display Memory usage
    echo "Memory Usage:"
    free -h

    # Display Disk usage
    echo "Disk Usage:"
    df -h | grep "^/dev"

    echo "-----------------------"
    sleep 5s
done

echo "Monitoring complete."
```

Save and Make Executable:

chmod 777 resource_monitor.sh

Run the Script:

    ./resource_monitor.sh

Reflection Questions
 * What information does the free -h command provide?
 * How can you modify the script to monitor network usage?
 * Why is automating system monitoring beneficial for administrators?
